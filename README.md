The whole document and impletement is mainly based on Python and R, several topics are based on other programming languages, e.g. C++, Nodejs, Swift and Go, etc. In Sophia, we introduce machine learning (ML) / deep learning (DL) models and further other ML-based or DL-based framework, including scikit-learn, CNTK, Tensorflow, Caffe, MXNet, GoogleNet, ..., etc. We try to provide everyone with more applicable tutorials for MI and AI.
