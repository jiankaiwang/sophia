# Sophia



![Build Status](https://cicd.ddns.net/buildStatus/icon?job=sophia)



The sophia project is the coding-based tutorial for machine intelligence (MI) and artificial intelligence (AI). The whole document and impletement is mainly based on Python and R, several topics are based on other programming languages, e.g. C++, Nodejs, Swift and Go, etc. In Sophia, we introduce machine learning (ML) / deep learning (DL) models and further other ML-based or DL-based framework, including scikit-learn, CNTK, Tensorflow, Caffe, MXNet, GoogleNet, ..., etc. On the other hand, we also focus on how to embed the MI/AI model into the IoT device, such as drone or integrated chips, etc. We try to provide everyone with more applicable tutorials for MI and AI. Please enjoy it.
