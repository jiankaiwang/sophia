# Keras

A high level and python-based deep learning library which supports using Tensorflow, CNTK, etc. as its backend engine. The Keras official website is https://keras.io/.

Here Keras in Sophia is the official Python library supporting multiple backends and also only supporting Tensorflow 1.x, not `tf.keras`.
